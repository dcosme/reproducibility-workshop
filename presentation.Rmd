## The reproducibility crisis

```{r out.width = '40%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/crisis.png")
```

> "**More than 70%** of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and **more than half** have failed to reproduce their own experiments."

## The reproducibility crisis

.pull-left[

* Attempted to replicate 100 published studies based on the original materials using high powered designs

* The mean replication effect size was **half the magnitude** (*M* = 0.20, *SD* = 0.26)

* **36%** of replication results were statistically significant (versus 97% of the original studies)

* **39%** of the replications were subjectively rated as replicating the original result

## Reproducibility versus replicability

--

**Reproducibility**

* Can a research finding be verified from the same data and code?

--

* Same research question, **same** data, *hopefully* the same results

--

**Replicability**

* Can a research finding be confirmed using the same methods, protocols and equipment?

--

* Same research question, **new** data, *hopefully* the same results

## Why does it matter?
```{r why, echo=FALSE}
xaringanExtra::use_editable(expires = 1)
```

.pull-right[

## Reproducible workflows

--

* The whole project: from design to publication and dissemination 

--

.footnote[Content adapted from [Reproducible Research Introduction from Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/rr-intro/01-introduction/index.html)]
  
* Facets of reproducibility:

  * **Documentation**: it's clear what happened and why; e.g. code is available and commented

--

  * **Organization**: it's clear where everything can be found; e.g. consistent file structures and naming conventions 

--

  * **Automation**: it's simple to reproduce processes; e.g. an analysis script can be executed to produce the same results

--

  * **Dissemination**: it's possible for others to reproduce your work; e.g. materials, code, and data (if possible) are publicly shared

---

## Reproducible workflows

```{r errors, echo=FALSE}
xaringanExtra::use_editable(expires = 1)
```

Reflect on your current workflow
